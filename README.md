#Penmount TouchScree install procedure for Raspberry PI and drivers

In this repository you can find a complete procedure to compile Rasbian kernel including Penmount TouchScreen Drivers.

The procedure "how to install touch screen driver.txt" is very long but works!

Special Thanks to [Eric](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=182721)
who wrote it.


As alternate possibility, the full set of drivers and related install procedure from Penmount is in tar.bz2 package.
I had no chances to successfully compile it, may be you will have more fortune.
